## Note
Ensure you have Python installed (recommended version: Python 3.8+) and also install pycharm.

The file main.py is the entry point of the project.

The Preprocess_data.py and Calculation.py handle data processing and analysis.

## üöÄ How to Install & Run
Follow these steps to set up and run the WhatsApp Chat Analyzer on your system.

## 1. Install Python
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your computer. If not, download and install it from python.org.

## 2. Install PyCharm (Optional but Recommended)
If you prefer an IDE, download and install PyCharm from jetbrains.com.

## 3. Set Up the Project

## Method 1: Using PyCharm

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open PyCharm and create a new project.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Copy and paste the following files into your project folder:

   main.py
   
   Preprocess_data.py
   
   Calculation.py
   
   requirements.txt
   
3Ô∏è‚É£ Open the PyCharm terminal (bottom of the window).

## Method 2: Using Command Line (Without PyCharm)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the project folder where you copied the files:

cd path/to/your/project

## 4. Install Required Libraries

In the PyCharm terminal or Command Prompt, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all the necessary dependencies like Pandas, Streamlit, and Regex.

## 5. Run the Application
Once the installation is complete, start the Streamlit app by running:

streamlit run main.py

This will open the app in your default web browser. üöÄ

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you see ModuleNotFoundError, make sure you installed the dependencies correctly (pip install -r requirements.txt).

If streamlit is not recognized, try running pip install streamlit.

If using PyCharm, make sure you're running commands in the terminal inside PyCharm, not the Python console.
